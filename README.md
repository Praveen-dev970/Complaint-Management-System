# Complaint Management System
In today's digital world, organizations and institutions are rapidly adopting software 
systems to improve internal communication and service management. One such critical 
area that demands efficiency is the management of user complaints, suggestions, and 
grievances. Typically, complaints are raised through verbal communication, handwritten 
notes, or informal emails, leading to a lack of tracking, responsibility, and follow-up. As a 
result, complaints may go unresolved, causing dissatisfaction and miscommunication. 
The Complaint Management System (CMS) addresses these challenges by providing a 
centralized, automated, and accessible platform that facilitates smooth handling of user
submitted complaints. It digitizes the complete lifecycle of a complaint—from submission 
and tracking to resolution and closure. This approach not only ensures that every complaint 
is acknowledged but also provides users with transparency and accountability, knowing 
the progress of their issues at any time. 
The system offers various features that support its objectives: - A role-based access system, ensuring users and administrators have different views and 
permissions. - Real-time complaint status updates visible to users on their dashboards. - Efficient data management using Django’s ORM to store, retrieve, and manipulate data 
reliably. - Use of modern UI components through Bootstrap and Material Dashboard for a professional 
and user-friendly interface. 
The core goal of this system is to minimize response time, increase service quality, and 
build trust between the users and the administration. The Complaint Management System 
provides a sustainable solution to a real-world administrative problem, paving the way for 
improved workflow, user experience, and institutional productivity.
